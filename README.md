# LevBoard (Experimental Version)
A Spotstats (stats.fm) integration for building customzable custom charts. 

This version is adapted to all of the custom features that I'm (lev-kochergin) am making for myself, which includes added filtering for songs & albums, and so much more. If you see something interesting here, message me, and I'll try to move it to the non-experimental version, although I do need to sync some of the features between the two versions, as this one has albums that won't work on the non-experimental version.

# To Use
Move over to the `main` branch, and it'll include all of the instructions on how to use the non-experimental version.
