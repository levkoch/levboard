# LevBoard [Archived Web App]
This is a [Spotistats](https://stats.fm/) integration for building customizable song charts. Currently, only creating song charts is available, due to some complications that Spotistats has with album versions. 

This is the (not even) half-baked web app version of LevBoard, here for archive purposes in case I decide to work on this some more. (I doubt I will, because if it's going to become a web app, it'll have to be turned into client-side JavaScript code so that it can be hosted on Github Pages.)

To use LevBoard (which gives you access to a lot more data) switch over to the `main` or `personal` branch and have fun there.

# To Run
Move over to the `/main` folder and start up Flask.
```console
flask run
```
