# LevBoard
This is a [Spotistats](https://stats.fm/) integration for building customizable song charts. Currently, only creating song charts is avaliable, due to some complications that Spotistats has with album versions. 

This is the version for web deployment. To use LevBoard on your computer (which gives you access to a whole lot more data) switch over to the `main` brach and have fun there.

# To Run
Move over to the `/main` folder and start up flask.
```console
flask run
```

# Contact Me
If you have any issues with the code, feel free to ask me over on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/levsnasty) where I post the charts created from the experimental version of this program. I am currently working on bringing these charts to the web so you can view them directly in your browser.
