# LevBoard (Experimental Version)
A stats.fm integration for building custom charts for your listening history. 

This version is adapted to all of the custom features that I'm (levkoch) am making for myself, which includes added filtering for songs & albums, and so much more. If you see something interesting here, message me, and I'll try to move it to the non-experimental version. This one has albums, which won't work on the non-experimental version unless you guys also want to help me create albums for the chart system (and also agree with the aggressive song and album merging choices that I've made.)

# To Use
Move over to the `others` branch (click [here](https://github.com/levkoch/levboard/tree/others)) or to the LevBoard web app coming soon, and it'll include all of the instructions on how to use the non-experimental version.
