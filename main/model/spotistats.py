"""
levboard/main/model/spotistats.py

A Module with common Spotistats requests to make it easier to make them.
I suggest importing the model and not the requests separately for readability.

Requests:
* `song_info`: Retrieves the info for a song.
* `song_plays`: Returns the song plays for a specific song id.
* `songs_week`: Returns the top songs for a specific time period.
* `song_play_history`: The history of the song's plays.
